Features

Supports animations on the following topics in Chemistry
1) Structure of an atom      : Different properties of elements, view of a periodic table<br />
2) Chemical bonding          : The different shapes of the VSEPR theory<br />
3) Crystal structure         : The different Bravais lattices<br />
4) Chemical reactions        : Combination, Decomposition, Single and Double displacement reactions<br />
5) Hybridization of Orbitals : Hybridization of orbitals in hydrocarbons, structure of various hydrocarbons and its properties.<br />
6) Organic Reactions         : Mechanism of different organic reactions.<br />
